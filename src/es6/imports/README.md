# Import

Usage of [import es6 feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import).

## Notes

As of version 7.2.0 of NodeJS, we are no able to use the import/from syntax
straight away. But using babel to translate es6 to es5, we can.

Since the purpose of this repo is to practice with Javascript syntax - not
only the subset support by Node - it looks like a good idea to make this transpiling.
