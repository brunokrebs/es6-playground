# ECMAScript playground

Here I will play with ECMAScript (any version) features to help me learn them.

## To study list (not in order):

- [The Angular 2 Compiler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW9cJsvcsGo)
- [Angular 4 Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJIMoLgqU_o&feature=youtu.be&t=9m10s)
- Hidden classes in javascript vms
- [Angular AoT compiler](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/cookbook/aot-compiler.html)
- [Angular Universal](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/angular-universal-for-the-rest-of-us-922ca8bac84#.i0pa0kaza)
- [RxJS](https://xgrommx.github.io/rx-book/why_rx.html)
- [Angular change detection](https://vsavkin.com/change-detection-in-angular-2-4f216b855d4c#.rtatwndau)
- [Angular testing guide](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/angular-2-testing-guide-a485b6cb1ef0#.y114vc9f3)
- [Javascript generators](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/how-to-generators-node-js-yield-use-cases/)

## NodeJS support

Some features, like the new
[import statement](http://es6-features.org/#ValueExportImport) are still not
supported by NodeJS (e.g. last checked import statement on NodeJS 7.2), so I use
babel with the 'latest' preset to compile my code to ECMAScript 5.

## Browser support

Well, there are a lot of browsers and with many different versions, so for sure many of them don't support a bunch
of ES6 features. That's  another reason to use babel.

## Resources

Some good resources that I found while learning about these features:
* [ECMAScript 6 â€” New Features: Overview & Comparison](http://es6-features.org/)
* [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
