# ECMAScript 6 playground

Here I will play with ECMAScript 6 features to help me learn them.

## NodeJS support

Some features, like the new (import statement)[http://es6-features.org/#ValueExportImport] are still not supported
by NodeJS (last checked import statement on NodeJS 7.2), so I use babel with the 'latest' preset to compile my code
to ECMAScript 5.

# Browser support

Well, there are a lot of browsers and with many different versions, so for sure many of them don't support a bunch
of ES6 features. That's  another reason to use babel.

## Resources

Some good resources that I found while learning about these features:
