# ECMAScript playground

Here I will play with ECMAScript (any version) features to help me learn them.

## NodeJS support

Some features, like the new
[import statement](http://es6-features.org/#ValueExportImport) are still not
supported by NodeJS (e.g. last checked import statement on NodeJS 7.2), so I use
babel with the 'latest' preset to compile my code to ECMAScript 5.

## Browser support

Well, there are a lot of browsers and with many different versions, so for sure many of them don't support a bunch
of ES6 features. That's  another reason to use babel.

## Resources

Some good resources that I found while learning about these features:
* [ECMAScript 6 â€” New Features: Overview & Comparison](http://es6-features.org/)
* [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)
